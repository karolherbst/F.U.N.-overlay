Subject: update wine pulse patch please

I saw your ebuild still making mention of aeikum's ancient pulse patch, written
in response to my original, unupdated patch, it's not the correct one and lacks
proper pulseaudio support (technical problems).

Please consider pulling http://repo.or.cz/w/wine/multimedia.git and leaving out
all commits after 'valgrind prevent crash hack', the rtkit ones specify audio
thread priority better, dsound has some love to make it work better against
pulse, and winmm is changed to fall back to alsa midi if pulseaudio is used.

The git tree usually gets updated on the same day or the day after a release,
but only if the patch series fails to apply. :-)
