note to maintainers

Some patches went in to the wine tree (mostly 1 liners), and I
reworked some of my earlier dsound patches. I don't expect any
regressions from that, but I did also introduce some new features.

Changes since 1.5.17:
One (1) of the dsound patches has made it through the review queue..
Cheers, I guess. :/

Changes since 1.5.16:

IP_UNICAST_IF fix is upstream.

Changes since 1.5.15:

I updated the rtkit patches now so that runaway realtime threads
can no longer lock up the system. This was always planned, but
unfortunately it had a bug where the timeout was 150 seconds, not
150 ms. I increased the timeout to 1 second, after which wineserver
will downgrade the offending processes threads. This hugely increases
the safety of enabling rtkit, and I would like to thank tizbac for
reporting it to me.

Furthermore I added a patch to enable IP_UNICAST_IF when compiling
against older headers, which allows you to enable broadcast support
on newer kernels when building against older headers.

I did some small changes to winepulse to decrease it's aggressiveness
of firing events. This shouldn't cause any playback regressions, but
if it does, please contact me!

Some small changes to dsound patches have been made, mostly fixes. I
don't expect any regressions, but again please let me know if they do.
